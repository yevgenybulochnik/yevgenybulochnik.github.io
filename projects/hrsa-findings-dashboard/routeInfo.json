A sudo ETL pipeline is setup using Scrapy and docker to obtain <a href=\"https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/program-integrity/index.html\">HRSA Program Integrity Data</a>. The data is adjusted to feed a Restapi using Scrapy items and pipelines. The api uses flask, sqlalchemy, marshmallow and webargs to allow for specific data queries and summaries. A modular &quot;dataService&quot; is used for the front end to allow a deployable version of the dashboard to github pages with data being embedded in the js bundle. The &quot;dataService&quot; is swappable on build using env vars. </p>\n"}},"path":"projects/hrsa-findings-dashboard"}
