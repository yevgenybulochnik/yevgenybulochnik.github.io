      Hello! and welcome to my website. My name is Eugene Bulochnik. I am an avid computer programmer and clinical pharmacist, currently living in the beautiful pacific northwest (Portland, OR). Originally I grew up in a town called Eden prairie, close to Minneapolis Minnesota.

      In 2012 I graduated from Drake University, with a Pharmacy Doctorate. I was accepted into the accelerated pharmacy program straight from highschool and completed my degree in 6 years. Currently, I hold my PharmD licence in the State of Oregon.

      As a kid I was always interested in computers. However, it wasn’t until college that I really had my first taste of coding. During an Internal Medicine rotation I developed a diabetes tracking application using visual basic and excel.

      Over the last 4 – 5 years I have started taking programming much more seriously. Whether its using ansible to provision servers or using typescript and react to develop an API/SPA, I am ecstatic. I find building something from scratch extremely gratifying and feel programming knowledge can be applied to almost any subject.
